I'm pleased to announce the immediate availability of Debezium **2.6.2.Final**.
This release is the second maintenance release that focuses on addressing several critical stability issues with the 2.6.1.Final release, support for Oracle database query filtering with more than one thousand tables, fixed race condition with PostgreSQL offset flushing, fixed Avro compatibility, and more.

Let's take a few moments and dive into these and more...

== New features and improvements

Debezium 2.6.2.Final introduces one new feature, lets take a look at it.

=== Oracle database query filtering with 1000+ tables

The Debezium Oracle connector allows configuring the table include and exclude lists to be applied as part of the database query for efficiency reasons using the `log.mining.query.filter.mode`.
When setting this configuration property to a value of `in`, the query is constructed using a SQL in-clause.
In Oracle, an in-clause is restricted to one thousand elements, and if your connector configuration exceeded this limit, the query would fail to execute.

Debezium 2.6 addresses this by creating sub-buckets of exactly one thousand elements and constructs the query using multiple in-clauses separated by a disjunction if the table include and exclude lists are too large.
This improves the user experience, allowing a single connector to capture more than one thousand tables with a single deployment, using the query filter mode, and without resorting to regular expressions. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7847[DBZ-7847]).

[id="important-fixes"]
== Fixes and stability improvements

Debezium 2.6.2.Final introduces several new bug fixes and stability improvements, lets take a look at a few of them.

=== PostgreSQL offset flush race condition

The Debezium PostgreSQL connector requires that not only do we publish offset metadata to Kafka to handle connector restarts, but the connector must also flush these details to the database's underlying replication slot to prevent unbounded WAL growth.

Using an example, let's propose we have two changes for LSN `1` and `2`.
Both of these changes are written to two different partitions, `A` and `B`, respectively.
As this happens asynchronously, it's possible that the write to partition `B` succeeds while the write to partition `A` fails.

If Debezium receives acknowledgement for partition `B` before `A`, the connector will synchronize the WAL confirmed LSN as `2`.
Should the connector fail before acknowledging partition `A` or get restarted due to a rebalance, upon connector restart the change for LSN `1` is lost.

This problem has been fixed in Debezium 2.6 onward, and the replication slot's confirmed LSN will correctly match the state in the topics (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7816[DBZ-7816]).

=== Avro compatibility

In Debezium 2.5, we introduced several new timestamp fields, `ts_us`, and `ts_ns`, which represent the millisecond-based time values in microseconds and nanoseconds.
Unfortunately, these fields were not introduced in a compatible way for users who use Avro (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7880[DBZ-7880]).

We have adjusted the change event schema so that the new fields introduced are optional, making the change event schema compatible with old versions so that users can upgrade to Debezium 2.6 or later without issues using Avro.
